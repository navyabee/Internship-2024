# Internship-2024
My summer 2024 internship at Epsilon involved analyzing large datasets about vehicle and vehicle sales for various car companies. I was tasked with finding trends and patterns in the marketing, sales, and repair data of cars, as well as understanding customer behavior. Boosting models helped me predict who is more likely to purchase auto manufacturerâ€™s EV vehicles.
